        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Gandhi was born on the 2nd of October, 1869, in the city of Porbandar,
           in present-day Gujarat, and was named Mohandas Gandhi. He came from 
           a Hindu family and his father served as the dewan, or chief minister,
           of several small princely states. As a child, Gandhi was shy and withdrawn.
           He was also deeply religious, spending hours reading religious texts such as
           the Bhagavad Gita.In 1883, at the age of thirteen, Gandhi married 14-year-old
           Kasturba Makhanji, a young girl who had been selected for him by his parents.

        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <p>Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led 
          nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building
          religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all,achieving 
          swaraj or self-rule.The most important point in Gandhi's scheme of education is 
          its emphasis on relating school education to the needs of the society. 
          He wanted to achieve this objective through a system of Learning while earning. 
          He gave an important place to the learning of craft.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>In some sense, Gandhi's greatest achievement lay in his legacy; for his ideals,
           and the example he provided in living them out, inspired, and continue to 
           inspire, people of all nations to take up the peaceful struggle for freedom 
           from oppression. Mahatma Gandhi's contribution to the Indian freedom struggle
           was immense. His philosophy of non-violence and civil disobedience, his tactics
           of non-cooperation and civil disobedience, and his leadership united the Indian
            masses and forced the British to confront the demands of the Indian people.</p>
